1. Bastions and snitches placed on Norlish territory are to be removed, and all prisoners (at the time of writing this, KarlBot) are to be released.
2. The Kannin Treaty will be rendered null and void. The trench in Ansgar (not to be confused with the Yggdrasil Vault) shall be destroyed and rendered unusable. The damages to the trench in Veria will be removed. NorlundSecure shall be given to Leobonet, King of Norlund. The carrot farms shown in the schedule shall be given to Norlund indefinitely, and the beetroot farms shall be made public to both Ansgar and Norlund, with Norlund gaining the right to the groups they were built on indefinitely. All Ansgar properties (homes, shops, infrastructure) within Kannin and other cantons are to be transferred to Norlund. Yggdrasil/Ansgar will remove any defensive infrastructure within Norlund (bunkers, pot bunkers, reinforced tunnels).
3. Norlund guarantees that people currently living in Ansgar retain their properties on Ansgar territory and are guaranteed the right to live in peace and for their work to remain in their hands forever.
4. The parties involved in the raiding of mainland Norlund may return stolen resources, pay reparations, and or help in fixing damages according to their conscience.
5. Blackwater will sign a white peace with Norlund and respect potential future Norlund claims in the expansion islands as long as they do not conflict with existing Blackwater claims. Blackwater has the right to defend contracted partiesâ€™ existing new world claims if they have been violated by Norlund, or are violated at any point beyond the time at which this treaty is signed.
