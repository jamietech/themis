## What does NorLII do?

The Norlund Legal Information Institute (NorLII) provides free, comprehensive and independent access to Norlish legal materials. NorLII's broad public policy agenda is to improve access to justice through better access to information.

NorLII publishes public legal information -- that is, primary legal materials (legislation, treaties and decisions of courts and tribunals).

## What is the future for NorLII?

Once all current and repealed legislation has been identified and added to NorLII, the Steering Committee intends to:
* create a public Github repository for the NorLII website (which will also allow the public to audit the content displayed on NorLII)
* draft and introduce legislation to allow NorLII to create reprints of legislation that conform with the new drafting standard, that is---
    * with named chapters, parts and sections
    * with numbered subsections and subparagraphs
    * for new legislation---with only one sentence per subsection (for an example of new legislation, see the [*Keeping it Friendly Act 2020*]({{< ref "acts/keeping-it-friendly.md" >}}))
    * provided that the meaning of the law is not to be affected by bringing it to conformance with the new drafting standard.
* identify and add all current and former treaties to which Norlund is or was a party
* identify and add all current and repealed executive orders of the Federal Council.
