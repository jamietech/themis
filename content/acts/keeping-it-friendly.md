### Preamble

In recognition of the fact that the main purpose of Norlund is to provide a safe and enjoyable place for residents and citizens to have fun while playing Minecraft, the House of Commons enacts the following Act to enshrine these values into law.

Anyone who talks in a Discord server controlled by Norlund or in any Norlund group in-game should---
* keep their conversations respectful and use common sense;
* make sure that they are doing things that further the enjoyment of everyone;
* not spread lies or rumours about others.

Norlund can and will moderate its public spaces to keep them free from hate speech and offensive communications. Norlund citizens and residents may resort to litigation where their rights are infringed.
