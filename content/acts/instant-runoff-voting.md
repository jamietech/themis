### 1 Prime Minister elections must be instant-runoff

Elections for Prime Minister must be under instant-runoff voting. Citizens must rank the candidates from best to worst. They can rank as many or as few candidates as they like.

### 2 How to count instant-runoff votes

The first votes of every citizen are counted, and if a candidate gets a simple majority of the first votes, they are elected. Otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated from the race (at random, should the lowest candidate be tied), and whoever had that candidate as their first vote, their vote will be transferred to their second choice vote. If they do not have a second choice vote, their vote is discarded. This process is repeated until a candidate achieves a simple majority.
